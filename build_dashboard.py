"""Build the dashboard from the analysis output.

`dashboard_body.html` is the template; every number in it comes from
`results.json`, which `analysis.py` writes. Nothing is typed in by hand, so the
page cannot drift from the analysis behind it.

    python analysis.py && python build_dashboard.py

Writes `index.html` — a single self-contained file (GitHub Pages serves it as-is).
